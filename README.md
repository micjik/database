# SQL uses Structured query language which have a predefined schemas while NoSQL have a dynamic schema for unstructured data.
# SQL uses vertical scaling while NoSQL uses horizontal scaling
# SQL uses multi table rows while NoSQL are document based which uses key-value bases
# SQL are used for structured data while NoSQL are used for unstructured data
